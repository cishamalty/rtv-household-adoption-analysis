# RTV-household-adoption-analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a **program monitoring and evaluation (M&E) analysis** of household-level adoption of **WASH**, **Agriculture**, and **VSLA** interventions implemented under the **Raising The Village (RTV)** initiative.

The analysis leverages structured monitoring data to assess adoption patterns, compare performance across geographic units, and support **evidence-based program decision-making**.

## Objectives
The key objectives of this project are to:

- Measure household adoption rates of RTV interventions
- Compare adoption across **WASH**, **Agriculture**, and **VSLA** components
- Analyze performance by **region**, **district**, and **cluster**
- Identify gaps and variations in program implementation
- Support **M&E reporting and learning**

## Data Description
The analysis is based on **household-level program monitoring data**, including:

- Household identifiers
- Geographic attributes (**region, district, cluster**)
- Participation and adoption indicators for **WASH, Agriculture, and VSLA**
- Program coverage and implementation markers

> **Note:** Sensitive or personally identifiable information is excluded. Shared data is for analytical demonstration purposes only.

## Methodology
The workflow follows standard **data analytics** and **M&E** practices:

- Data cleaning and validation
- Feature selection and recoding of adoption indicators
- Aggregation by program component and geography
- Descriptive statistics and comparative analysis
- Visualization of adoption trends and performance metrics

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and aggregation
- **NumPy** – numerical computations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – exploratory analysis and reporting

## Key Outputs
- Household adoption rates by intervention type
- Geographic performance summaries (**region, district, cluster**)
- Visual insights for program monitoring
- Structured outputs suitable for dashboards and reports

## Use Cases
This analysis can support:

- **Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) reporting**
- Program performance reviews
- Data inputs for **Power BI dashboards**
- Targeted follow-up interventions in low-adoption areas
